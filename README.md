## CS-458-Assignment-1
This project is a WebGL unity application that shows blocks being randomly created that fly towards the camera. The blocks can either be red or blue and they will be destroyed if they hit the cylinder that has the same color as the block.

to see this application you must go to the [github page](https://dinguspingus.github.io/CS-458-Assignment-1/) with this repository.
